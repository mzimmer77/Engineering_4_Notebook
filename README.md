## Launchpad_P1 

### Assignment Description

In Launch Pad Part 1, we had to countdown from 10 seconds down to Liftoff (at 0 seconds). That countdown must be printed to the serial monitor.

### Evidence 
![Something like this](https://github.com/mzimmer77/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/images/CountdownP1.gif.gif).

 

### Wiring

The wiring consisted of plugging the PICO board into my computer.

### Code
``` python
# type: ignore #ignores problems
import time #adds time

for x in range (10,0,-1): #using intervals that start at 10 and go to 0 with intervals every -1 
    print (x) #prints my numbers as x
    time.sleep (1) #counts down every second
print ("we have liftoff") #prints we have liftoff

```  
### Reflection
This project was a great refresher for my python skills. I used the "for x in range (10,0,-1)" to make my intervals which would go down by 1. I learned/ remembered the syntax which was honestly annoying but it is pretty simple once you remember it (the key is to use commas for the loop).

### Part Link 

[Create a link to your Onshape document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/003e413cee57f7ccccaa15c2/w/ea71050bb283bf3bf088c96c/e/c85ae532263d3b551e1795d0?renderMode=0&uiState=62d9b9d7883c4f335ec42021). Don't forget to turn on link sharing in your Onshape document so that others can see it. 

### Part Image

Take a nice screenshot of your Onshape document. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
